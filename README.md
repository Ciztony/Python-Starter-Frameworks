# Python Starter Frameworks for new Python developers

The frameworks contains various folders like assets and src to store their dependencies, as well as a README file.

The Pygame framework is packaged with my own window and perlin classes.

The Terminal framework is packaged with a base terminal application class.

Provides a **basic architecture** for new Python developers wanting to develop their first application.

_Note to new devs: Please delete **ALL** .gitkeep files in the directories as they are **PLACEHOLDER FILES** to make them appear on GitHub as you can see_
